# Install Lokka

This quick start guide will help you set up Lokka with the minimum configuration needed to get started.

If you want to learn more about the advanced configuration options, see the [Advanced Install Guide](/docs/install-advanced).

## Pre-requisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - If you already have Node v22.10 or higher installed you can skip this step.
  - Check by running `node -v` at the command prompt.

## Configure the agent

You can use the Lokka agent tool with any compatible MCP client and LLM combo.

Claude is the simplest way to get started and provides the best experience. You can use the free version of Claude Desktop to test Lokka (there are daily limits on the free version).

GitHub Copilot Agent in VS Code is another great option.

  - On Mac, you can find the settings in the top menu bar under **Claude** > **Settings** (or press `Cmd + ,`).

  - Note: If you don't see the Developer tab, you need to enable it first from `Help` > `Enable Developer Mode`.
- This opens explorer, edit `claude_desktop_config.json` in your favorite text editor.
- Add the following configuration to the file.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Lokka-Microsoft": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@merill/lokka"]
    }
  }
}
```

- Exit Claude Desktop and restart it.
  - Every time you make changes to the code or configuration, you need to restart Claude desktop for the changes to take effect.
  - Note: In Windows, Claude doesn't exit when you close the window, it runs in the background. You can find it in the system tray. Right-click on the icon and select **Quit** to exit the application completely.

### Testing the agent

- Open the Claude Desktop application.
- You should see new browser window open and prompt you to sign into your Microsoft tenant.
- Now you can start quering your Microsoft tenant using the Lokka agent tool.
- Some sample queries you can try are:
  - `Get all users in my tenant`
  - `Show me the details for John Doe`
  - `Change John's department to IT` - Needs User.ReadWrite.All permission to be granted
  - `How many VMs do I have in my subscription?` - Needs Reader permission to be granted to the Azure subscription
